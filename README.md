# Turbulent Flow of Water-based Optimization (TFWO) 


a new optimization method based on Turbulent Flow of Water-based Optimization (TFWO) is presented. This method has been inspired by the natural and random behavior of vortices in rivers, seas and oceans. We also investigate the application of the proposed algorithm in solving benchmark and real-world problems.
